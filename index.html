      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Samuel Chiazalam Ugbo, a 17-year-old from Abia State,
        Nigeria. Currently reside in the city of Abuja. A passionate and eager
        learner with a strong interest in technology and engineering. As a
        recent high school graduate, I am excited to begin my journey in backend
        development, with hopes of eventually becoming a full-stack developer. I
        have always been passionate about technology and it's potential to
        change the world. Rather than going to College, I decided to dive into
        the tech field early to gain practical experience and skills. Iâ€™m
        excited to grow my skills and contribute to collaborative projects in
        the field of backend development. Joining the ALT School of Engineering
        is my first step toward taking on new challenges and advancing my
        knowledge.
